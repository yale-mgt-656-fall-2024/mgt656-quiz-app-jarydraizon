## Wtf is this?

I want to practice the questions but the format that Kyle gave them to us in is boring. 

I'm thinking of putting all questions into one .txt file and writing a web app to parse that file, show one of the questions, and allow a user to select an answer. 

The web app will then show if the user was correct or show the correct answer if they got it wrong.

Future development: I'd love to link this up with an LLM so that the user can "ask for an explanation" if they don't understand a concept.
